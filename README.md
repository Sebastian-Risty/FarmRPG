# FarmRPG

Simple BOT for web based game FarmRPG
Wrote this over my spring break and my main objective was to work with the Windows api in regards to input and reading the colors on screen

I believe that using a lib such as selenium would be a better solution to this

You will be banned if you use this without taking further precautions that I will not be adding as I have lost interest in the game

Enjoy
